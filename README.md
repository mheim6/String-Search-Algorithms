# String-Search-Algorithms
The first is naive multi-ocurrance string search, the second is Rabin-Karp multi occurrence string search and the last function is to implement Knuh-Morris-Pratt multi-ocurrence string search. I decided to go ahead and implement this function in python. They are 3 different files and run each algorithm a couple of times and above is my observations of each algorithm. The way you run my assignment is by having the 4 different files in the same folder and just running the file called test_driver.py, this will run everything and print out the results of each test case and the runtimes.
